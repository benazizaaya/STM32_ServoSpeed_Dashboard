# STM32_ServoSpeed_Dashboard


This repository contains a project designed to measure and display the average speed of a servomotor in both rotational directions. The implementation uses the STM32F407VG6 DISC board, an LCD display, and a few connecting wires. The project calculates the average speed of the servomotor for each direction (clockwise and counterclockwise) and outputs the results on the LCD screen.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an STM32 microcontroller to:

Measure the speed of a servo motor.
Calculate the average speed for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation.
Display the calculated average speed on an LCD display in real-time.
Components Used:
Servo Motor: Used for controlling rotational motion.
STM32F407VG6 DISC Board: The microcontroller used to calculate and control the system.
LCD Display: Displays the average speed of the servomotor.
Wires: For connecting the components.
